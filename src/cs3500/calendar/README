for the actual schedule, what we could do to edit the events is directly pass the events to the
    central system instead of having to create a ton of functions in the schedule. We would just
    need to ensure there is no way of a schedule being given direct access to anyone outside of
    the central system. IE all schedules can only be made through the central and any that are
    passed in are fully duplicated.
        -this way we dont need 500 methods in schedule just to add or modify events. just pass
            them up
        - cant bc then there is no way of checking for event overlap in the schedule


- what happens if add event to invitee but they already have an event at that time
