The `XMLReader` class serves as a utility for parsing user and event information from an XML file to construct a `User` object complete with a detailed schedule of events. This class is a crucial component for applications that require loading user schedules and associated events from external XML sources, offering a way to dynamically populate the application's data structures. Below is a detailed documentation of its structure and functionalities:

### Class Overview: XMLReader
- **Purpose:** To read user and event information from an XML file, creating a `User` object that includes a schedule populated with events defined in the XML file.

### Methods
- **`static User readXML(String path)`**
  - Reads an XML document specified by the `path` parameter to extract user and event information. It constructs a `User` object representing the schedule owner, including their schedule populated with events. The method processes each event node within the XML, extracting details such as event name, location, timing, online status, and a list of invited users, to create `Event` objects and add them to the user's schedule.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `path`: The file path of the XML document to be read.
  - **Returns:** A `User` object representing the owner of the schedule, populated with events extracted from the XML file.
  - **Throws:** `RuntimeException` if an error occurs during XML parsing or document processing. This ensures that calling methods are aware of potential failures in the XML reading process.

### Usage and Behavior

This method is a key integration point for systems that need to load scheduling data from external sources, offering a bridge between static XML documents and dynamic application data structures.
- By creating both `User` and `Event` objects based on the contents of the XML file, this class enables complex scheduling information to be imported into an application, making it particularly useful for initializing the state of scheduling or calendar management applications with predefined data.

### Design Considerations
- The use of a static method for XML reading highlights the utility nature of the `XMLReader` class, suggesting that it does not maintain state and is designed to be called without instantiation. This design choice is aligned with the class's role as a data loader rather than a component of the application's core logic.
- Error handling within the method throws a `RuntimeException` upon encountering any issues during XML parsing or processing. This approach simplifies error handling for calling methods but requires that users of the `XMLReader` class be prepared to handle such unchecked exceptions, ensuring robustness in application design.
- The class directly interacts with the DOM API to parse XML documents, reflecting a lower-level approach to XML processing. This allows for precise control over how XML data is interpreted and mapped to application-specific data structures but also implies that callers must adhere to the expected XML schema for successful parsing.

### Integration with Other Classes
- Integration with the `User`, `Schedule`, and `Event` classes demonstrates the interconnected nature of the application's data model. `XMLReader` acts as a conduit for transforming external XML data into instances of these classes, bridging the gap between static data representations and dynamic, in-memory objects.
- The functionality provided by `XMLReader` complements the other classes by enabling the dynamic loading of scheduling data, enhancing the flexibility and usability of the scheduling system.

  - **Parameters:**
    - `user`: The user whose schedule is to be written to an XML file. This user's schedule is traversed to extract event details.
    - `filePath`: The path of the file where the generated XML content will be saved.
  - The method utilizes `DocumentBuilderFactory` and `DocumentBuilder` to create a new XML document. It constructs a hierarchical structure reflecting the user's schedule and the details of each event, using `Element` nodes to represent the schedule and its events in XML format.
  - After constructing the XML structure, the method uses `TransformerFactory` and `Transformer` to convert the DOM representation into XML text, formatting the output for readability with indentation, and writes the XML to the specified file path.

- **`private static void createChildElement(Document doc, Element parent, String tagName, String textContent)`**
  - A utility method that simplifies the DOM manipulation process by creating a child element with the specified tag name and text content, and appending it to a given parent element.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `doc`: The `Document` object within which the new element is created. This object represents the XML document being constructed.
    - `parent`: The parent `Element` to which the new child element will be appended.
    - `tagName`: The tag name for the new element.
    - `textContent`: The text content for the new element.

### Usage and Behavior
- The `writeXML` method serves as the primary interface of the `XMLWriter` class, offering a straightforward way to serialize a user's schedule into XML format. By iterating over each event in the user's schedule, the method ensures that all relevant details are captured in the XML document.
- The method organizes the XML document in a structured manner, reflecting the hierarchical relationship between the schedule, events, and event details. This structured approach not only facilitates readability of the XML document but also enables easy parsing by other software components or systems.
- The use of `createChildElement` within `writeXML` highlights an efficient approach to DOM manipulation, reducing code redundancy and improving readability by abstracting the common pattern of element creation and text content assignment.

### Design Considerations
- Employing static methods emphasizes the utility nature of the `XMLWriter` class, indicating its stateless functionality designed for direct invocation without needing an instance of the class.
- The decision to catch and print exceptions within `writeXML` allows the method to handle errors gracefully, providing debug information without halting execution. However, in more complex applications, it might be beneficial to throw custom exceptions to allow calling code to manage errors more flexibly.

## Controller Architecture

### Overview
We attempted to implement all possible facets of the controller, but we realized a lot of the portions of our view were made in a very bad way so we were unable to actually implement some of the controllers features fully.

### Interfaces & Classes

### Changes made
We had to completely redesign our view and this is what messed up our timeline, but the view is now better in most ways and is a lot easier to modify going forward.

### PlannerController
In our planner controller we have attempted to add all the functionalities and have succeeded in most.

### Schedule Auto

In the AutoEventFrame class we have set up and created a view that will auto schedule, but the logic is yet to be implemented.
